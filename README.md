### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a PhD student at the University of Cambridge working on data analysis techniques for 21-cm cosmology (check out [maxsmooth](https://github.com/htjb/maxsmooth) and [globalemu](https://github.com/htjb/globalemu) below). I have a keen interest in all things cosmology and data analysis.
